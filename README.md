The project is implemented using native Java. For database connectivity, it uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The user interface is designed using Java Swing. Essentially, this branch represents a more traditional Java application that directly interacts with the database and uses desktop GUI for user interactions.

# Disclaimer:
The MAIN branch was mainly completed by my classmate WenXin Wu and her classmate at New York University.
