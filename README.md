# CheapRent--The webcrawler that helps you find the best apartment!
This is a Full-Stack WebCrawler Project used to craw cheap house-renting according to given housing website

# Main Branch
In the Main branch, the project is implemented using native Java. For database connectivity, it uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The user interface is designed using Java Swing. Essentially, this branch represents a more traditional Java application that directly interacts with the database and uses desktop GUI for user interactions.

# Full-Stack Branch
On the other hand, the Full-Stack branch is a complete rewrite of the project using modern frameworks and libraries. The backend is built using Spring Boot, which provides a robust and scalable framework for server-side development. For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), Hibernate is used, making data manipulation more abstract and easier to manage.

The frontend is developed using React.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. This allows for a more dynamic and interactive UI.

Architecturally, the project adopts a three-tier structure comprising the Persistence Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Presentation Layer. The Persistence Layer handles the database operations, the Business Logic Layer contains the core functionalities, and the Presentation Layer is responsible for interacting with the users.

This separation makes the system easier to manage, scalable, and also more aligned with modern full-stack development practices.

# Disclaimer:
The MAIN branch was mainly completed by my classmate WenXin Wu and her classmate at New York University.
